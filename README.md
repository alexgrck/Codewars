# My Codewars Challenges

In this repo I upload my Codewars challenges I try to solve (almost) every day.

# How It's Made

Tech used: Python

I create a new directory for particular day and then I create files for different katas, and then I push the directory to repo.

# Why Codewars?

I bumped into Codewars on Stackoverflow while googling for hints to solve my problem. Thanks to this, I found a great source of challenges which exercises my brain and are a little escape from bigger projects.
Codewars challenges help me practise using Python coding I'm already familiar with, and getting to know new Python practices.
